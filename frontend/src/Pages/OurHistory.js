                    The Lord told us in 2011 to start the church arm of the ministry, but it was another tough decision. Our lives revolve around CAC Chapel of Praise Akure, where I've been a member for ten years. In November 2013, the Lord told me I was wasting away. I left after taking precautions. Like living certainty for uncertainty. Doing this my whole Christian life. Since I have a family, it was much harder this time. The first Sunday in November 2013, the church prayed for our departure. Reverend Enoch's family left months earlier. So, we asked the Lord how to proceed, and by the Holy Spirit, the Church arm of SEPCAM began with my family and Rev. Enoch's family in a Bible study session on Wednesday, November 20, 2013, in a small auditorium in my residence at Plot 31-32, Ifelodun Community, along Akure-Ilesha Motorway, Akure Ondo State, where we hold our monthly vigils. The next Sunday, November 24, 2013, 15 brothers worshipped together. 


Pastor J. J. Omotoso spiritually inaugurated the Sceptre of Power Ministry (SEPCAM) Church arm on Sunday, January 5, 2014. The church has grown greatly since its founding. After a three-day powerful open-air Gospel crusade, SEPCAM (Ipinsa Assembly) opened its first branch in 2017. Sunday worship services in Ifelodun and Ipinsa assemblies currently draw 250 brethren. The trustees, pastorate, ministers, workers, and general assembly run the church. In Jesus' name, Amen, the church persists and hell cannot stop it.
